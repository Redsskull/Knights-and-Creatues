Choose a class:

Warrior
------
When I was young I enjoyed playing with sticks and stones, fighting and defeating all of my father's scarecrows, 
dreamed about becoming a powerful warrior that defeats his foes and now here I am, ready for my next challenge!
------


Mage 
------
Are you thirsty? sorry, my water is not drinkable!
Hungry? I can... cook... our enemies!
Travel from town to town in a blink of an eye? show me your money!
------


Bard 
------
In a realm of Myst
Where the dreams come true,
There we are in search of Bartholomew
Also known as 'Bart the claw cuddler'

And I have no idea how we will rescue him
Deep in darkness is where we go
Fingers crossed is what we hope
Bart, here we come!
--------


Clerk 
-----
In this dark world, instead of using swords, shields, or knives, I prefer to use my hands... to pray and heal others, 
but also to unleash the holy power upon our enemies, I prefer to work with a group of misfits, but in the end, 
if you pay me enough... I mean if you show me your great gratitude, I can go anywhere
